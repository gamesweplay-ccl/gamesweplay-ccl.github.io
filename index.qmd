# **&nbsp;About These Games**
This collection of games has been curated for a variety of situations to meet several curricular goals. You will find resources for this (where relevant) on the game pages. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hCDHz6vS9PuA_KgVw0_3o5RFWZhisK7U/view?usp=sharing) is a PDF of the entire games manual. 

In order to play these games you will often need pen, paper, dice and tokens in two colours. 20mm buttons work well. Some games have custom cards or game boards – black and white versions can be downloaded here. \

\

### Types of Games
Most games have simple rules. The games are split into games that can be used in the Mathematics and Science classrooms. Some games are good for Language or Social and Emotional Learning. To indicate game type, the manual and page background are colour coded. \


<span class="color-box" style="background-color: rgb(240, 136, 75);"></span> Mathematics and Probability \
<span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f7ee4c;"></span> Strategy \
<span class="color-box" style="background-color: #b3d34a;"></span> Science and Deduction \
<span class="color-box" style="background-color: #8cd6ea;"></span> SEL \

### Complexity
We enjoy playing even the simplest of these so a low complexity game is not just for primary school. However here is a rough correlation between age and complexity.

<!-- We catergorize each game in terms of Complexity. A higher complexity simply means that the rules are more intricate. Each game, regardless of complexity is meant to be enjoyed and played by all. -->
