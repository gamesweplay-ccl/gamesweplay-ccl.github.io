# **About These Games**
This collection of games for the classroom has been curated for a variety of situations. In order to use these in the classroom you will usually need pens, paper and dice. Some games have custom cards or game boards – black and white versions can be downloaded here. \

<!-- There is some game in this collection for everyone and every setting. To play most of these games, you simply need some pens, paper, dice and the game board. You can find the printable game boards on each game's page. If you have the Game Box, then you already have all of that with you!\ -->

\

### Types of Games
Most games have simple rules. The games are split into games that can be used in the mathematics, SEL (Social and Emotional Learning), science classroom as well as some strategy games that give you alternatives to chess and checkers.

<!-- Most games have simple rules. Each game is focused on a particular area of learning, and hence are split into these color coded categories to be used in different classrooms. -->


<span class="color-box" style="background-color: rgb(240, 136, 75);"></span> Mathematics and Probability \
<span class="color-box" style="background-color: #8cd6ea;"></span> Language and Social \
<span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f7ee4c;"></span> Strategy \
<span class="color-box" style="background-color: #b3d34a;"></span> Science and Deduction \

\

### Complexity
We enjoy playing even the simplest of these so a low complexity game is not just for primary school. However here is a rough correlation between age and complexity.

<!-- We catergorize each game in terms of Complexity. A higher complexity simply means that the rules are more intricate. Each game, regardless of complexity is meant to be enjoyed and played by all. -->
