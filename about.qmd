# **About Our Games**

This collection of games for the classroom has been curated for a variety of situations. In order to use these in the classroom you will usually need pens, paper and dice. Some games have custom cards or game boards â€“ black and white versions can be downloaded and printed here. \

Most games have simple rules. The games are split into games that can be used in the mathematics, SEL, science classroom as well as some strategy games that give you alternatives to chess and checkers. \

We enjoy playing even the simplest of these so a low complexity game is not just for primary school. However here is a rough correlation between age and complexity \

### Age Groups

- **Primary**: Suitable for younger players
- **Middle**: Intermediate complexity
- **High**: More challenging games

*Note: Complexity broadly classifies Primary games for classes 3 and up, Middle games for classes 6 and up, and High games for classes 8 and up.*



### Player Counts
- Single-player puzzles
- Two-player strategy games
- Small group games (3-6 players)
