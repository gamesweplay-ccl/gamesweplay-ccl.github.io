    "text": "Welcome to Games at CCL!\nThis is a selection of games curated at the Centre for Creative Learning, IIT Gandhinagar. These games can be recreated with easily available material and you will find rules, videos and boards to play them here. :-)\n\nWhat kind of game are you looking for? Let us pick one for you or answer these questions for a more customized selection!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n About These Games\nThis collection of games has been curated for a variety of situations to meet several curricular goals. You will find resources for this (where relevant) on the game pages. Here is a PDF of the entire games manual.\nIn order to play these games you will often need pen, paper, dice and tokens in two colours. 20mm buttons work well. Some games have custom cards or game boards – black and white versions can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Games\nMost games have simple rules. The games are split into games that can be used in the Mathematics and Science classrooms. Some games are good for Language or Social and Emotional Learning. To indicate game type, the manual and page background are colour coded.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\nWe enjoy playing even the simplest of these so a low complexity game is not just for primary school.
