You will find resources for this (where relevant) on the game pages. Here is a PDF of the entire games manual.\nIn order to play these games you will often need pen, paper, dice and tokens in two colours. 20mm buttons work well. Some games have custom cards or game boards – black and white versions can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Games\nMost games have simple rules. The games are split into games that can be used in the Mathematics and Science classrooms. Some games are good for Language or Social and Emotional Learning. To indicate game type, the manual and page background are colour coded.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\nWe enjoy playing even the simplest of these so a low complexity game is not just for primary school. However here is a rough correlation between age and complexity.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    Simple rules.\n  \n  \n    Class 3 (8 years) +\n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Somewhat complicated rules or strategy.\n  \n  \n    Class 6 (11 years) +\n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    More challenging rules or strategy.\n  \n  \n    Class 9 (14 years) +\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Counts\nWe have games for different player counts.\n\n  \n    Solo\n  \n  \n    These are games for 1 player\n  \n\n  \n    2 players\n  \n  \n    These are mostly strategy games and support exactly 2 players\n  \n\n  \n    Between 3 and 10\n  \n  \n    These games can be played with more than 2 but less than 10 players\n  \n\n  \n    10 and more\n  \n  \n    Games for 10 or more!
