    "text": "About Our Games\nThis collection of games for the classroom has been curated for a variety of situations. In order to use these in the classroom you will usually need pens, paper and dice. Some games have custom cards or game boards – black and white versions can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Games\nMost games have simple rules. The games are split into games that can be used in the mathematics, SEL (Social and Emotional Learning), science classroom as well as some strategy games that give you alternatives to chess and checkers.\n\nMathematics and Probability\nLanguage and Social\nStrategy\nScience and Deduction\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\nWe enjoy playing even the simplest of these so a low complexity game is not just for primary school. However here is a rough correlation between age and complexity.\n★      Suitable for younger players, for class 3 (8 and above)\n★★      Intermediate complexity, for class 6 (11 and above)\n★★★      More challenging games, for class 9 (14 and above)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Counts\nWe have games for different player counts.\nSolo:     These are games (or puzzles) for 1 player.\n2 players:     These are mostly strategy games and support exactly 2 players\nBetween 3 and 10:     These games can be played with more than 2 but less than 10 players.\n10 and more:     Games for 10 or more! These can be played simultaneously by an entire class."
