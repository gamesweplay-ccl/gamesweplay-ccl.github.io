    "text": "Welcome to Games at CCL!\nThis is a selection of games curated at the Centre for Creative Learning, IIT Gandhinagar. These games can be recreated with easily accesible material and you will find rules, videos and boards to play them here. :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout These Games\nThis collection of games has been curated for a variety of situations to meet several curricular goals. You will find resources for this (where relevant) on the game pages. Here is a PDF for all of the games manuals.\nIn order to play them you will often need pen, paper, dice and tokens in two colours. Buttons of size 20mm work well. Some games have custom cards or game boards – black and white versions can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Games\nMost games displayed here have simple rules. They are split into games that can be used in the Mathematics and Science classrooms. Some are also good for Language or Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). To indicate game type, the manual and page background are colour coded.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\nWe enjoy playing even the simplest of these so a low complexity game is not just for primary school. However here is a rough correlation between age and complexity.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    Simple rules.\n    Class 3 (8 years) +\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    Somewhat complicated rules or strategy.\n    Class 6 (11 years) +\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    More challenging rules or strategy.\n    Class 9 (14 years) +\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Counts\nWe have games for different numbers of players. ‘Solo’ indicates games for one player (solo play), ‘2 players’ are typically strategy games that support exactly two players, ‘Between 3 and 10’ is for games that can be played with more than two but less than 10, and ‘10 and more’ are for very large groups - get the whole class to play!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind a game to play\nWhat kind of game are you looking for?
